## Description

Clone the repository by running this command in a terminal:
    git clone https://github.com/uva-cs3140-fa22/hw7-xtz3mx-cxy6nx-amy6zx.git

Change directories into hw7-xtz3mx-cxy6nx-amy6zx and complete project build with ./gradlew build. 
Then copy the starter database "Reviews.sqlite3" in the hw7-xtz3mx-cxy6nx-amy6zx to the build/libs folder. If you do not do this, then the program will automatically create an empty database and there will be no starter data to work with. Also, make sure you move the starter database to the build/libs folder before running the program for the first time.
Finally, execute the jar file with java -jar Reviews.jar.
Follow the prompts to log in and write or see course reviews.

For IDE's, our program is driven by the main method in the CommandLineUI class. Run configurations should have the 
module specified as HooReviews.main.
